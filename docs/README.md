# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management process documentation. This repository contains comprehensive guides for running projects end-to-end using OctoAcme's iterative, customer-focused approach.

## Purpose

These process documents help teams:
- Understand OctoAcme's standardized project lifecycle and best practices
- Navigate from project initiation through delivery and continuous improvement
- Access templates, checklists, and guidance for each phase
- Maintain consistency across projects while enabling team autonomy
- Onboard new team members quickly with clear, actionable documentation

## Key Principles

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on:
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments to learn and adapt quickly
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has defined roles and accountabilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

## Project Lifecycle Phases

OctoAcme projects follow a structured lifecycle with clear decision gates:

1. **Initiation** — Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and define success criteria
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and create a release plan
3. **Execution & Tracking** — Build, test, and iterate with regular progress monitoring
4. **Risk Management & Communication** — Proactively identify risks and maintain stakeholder alignment
5. **Release & Deployment** — Safely deploy features to production with proper verification
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — Capture learnings and turn them into action items

## Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria are met
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, decisions, and approvals throughout the lifecycle

See [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed responsibilities and goals.
